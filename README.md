# Movieclassifier
A model that classifies movies into genres.
Movie Genre Classification
Task Overview
This project aims to classify movie genres based on their descriptions using machine learning. The model is trained on labeled data with movie descriptions and their respective genres. The main objective is to predict the genre of a movie from its description.

Objective
Train a machine learning model to classify movie descriptions into genres.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

Steps to Run the Project
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-genre-classification.git
cd movie-genre-classification
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Main Script

To train and evaluate the model, run the classifier.py script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python classifier.py
This will:

Load and preprocess the training data (train_data.txt).

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Output the accuracy and classification report.

Test the Model

For predicting movie genres on new data, ensure you have a test_data.txt file and run the script again.

Code Structure
classifier.py: Main script for training the model, preprocessing, and evaluation.

train_data.txt: Training data with movie descriptions and genres.

test_data.txt: Test data for making predictions.

requirements.txt: Python libraries required for the project.

Model Evaluation
The modelâ€™s accuracy is calculated and presented along with a classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each genre.

Why the Accuracy is Lower: The accuracy might be lower because the model is evaluated on a separate test file (test_data.txt). This could lead to reduced performance as the model may not generalize well to unseen data.

Improving Accuracy: The performance can be improved by:

Using Cross-Validation: Splitting the data into multiple parts (folds) for more robust training.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting model parameters to find the best settings.

Using Larger or More Diverse Datasets: A larger, more varied training dataset can help the model learn better
